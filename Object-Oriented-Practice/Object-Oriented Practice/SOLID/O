/*Open/Closed principle

Class should be open for extension, closed for modification.
DO NOT do the following. If your class has an if cluase checking for a condition 
of state, you're breaking this principle.  

class Animal{
  private String Type;
  String Says(){
    if(Type.Equals("dog")) return "woof";
    if(Type.Equals("cat")) return "meow";
    return "";
  }
}

Instead, make a base class and then make classes that have their unique 
implementations EXTEND the base class.

class Animal{
  public void says(String speak)
  {
    System.out.println(speak)
  }
}
class Dog extends Animal{
  String speak = "woof"; 
}
class Cat extends Animal{
  String speak = "meow"; 
}*/
