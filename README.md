lThis is a little project that I did during my semester in object-oriented 
design to showcase almost everything we learned in the class. It shows 
the syntax and basics of Java, shows how to utilize tries/catches, 
inheritance/polymorphism, the SOLID principles, how to use interfaces, 
and includes a short list of some best practices as well as the primitive 
types we learned.   

To fully understand what is happening, it is recommended that the user 
first compiles and then follows along (starting from Main.java) with the 
comments/code line-by-line as they look at the output. 

A user can run the program with the following Linux command:
java -jar objectorientedpractice.jar
